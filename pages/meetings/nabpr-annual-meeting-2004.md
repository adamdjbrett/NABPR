The twenty-fourth annual meeting of the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion

was called to order by President Nancy deClaisse-Walford. Danny Mynatt, Executive Secretary,

greeted members and guests and introduced the program for the meeting.

deClaisse-Walford introduced Bob Patterson, who presented the 2003 Festschrift in memory of

John Newport. Dr. Newport’s grandson, Nicholas Bailey, accepted the Festschrift and thanked

the Association on behalf of his family. Bill Bellinger introduced President deClaisse-Walford for

the Presidential Address, “Confessions of a Canonical Critic.” At the conclusion of the address,

deClaisse-Walford opened the floor for questions and comments from the Association, which

were moderated by Bellinger.

Helen Lee Turner introduced presenters for a discussion on the topic, “Forming Baptist

Identity(ies) in American Higher Education.” Presenters were Glenn Hinson (Emeritus, Baptist

Theological Seminary at Richmond), Dianne Oliver (University of Evansville), and Ralph Wood

(Baylor University).

At 11:00, President deClaisse-Walford convened the annual business session. After the 2003

minutes were approved, Executive Secretary Danny Mynatt gave the Executive Committee

report. Mynatt updated the membership on the current status of the Council of Societies for the

Study of Religion office, which has fallen behind on its administrative tasks following the death of

CSSR executive director, Dr. David Truemper, and the departure of two staff members. The delay

in CSSR productivity meant that the NABPR had received no financial reports for six months.

Danny Mynatt and Jimmy Byrd attended the CSSR meeting on Friday night to represent the

NABPR and voice the association’s concerns. At the meeting, the CSSR discussed a plan for

reopening the office and have it in order by 15 February. In light of this plan, the NABPR

Executive committee determined that the best option was to remain with the CSSR for the time

being. Mynatt noted that the NABPR endowment funds were doing quite well with a rate of return

at nearly 17% over the previous year. Mynatt reported that the new idea for an NABPR job

placement site was not going well due to lack of participation. The Executive Committee

recommended that the NABPR continue the placement site and evaluate it after one additional

year.

After the Executive Committee report, Assistant Executive Secretary Jimmy Byrd read the names

of nominations for new members into the association. After the new members were approved,

deClaisse-Walford recognized Sandra Polaski, who offered the nominations of Mike Parsons for

president and Curtis Freeman for vice president of the Association for 2005. There was no

opposition, and the nominees were elected by unanimous vote. deClaisse-Walford then

recognized Scott Nash for the report of the Editorial Board. Nash noted that Baylor University

Press would launch the PRS monograph series, with Stephen Chapman of Duke University

Divinity School serving as chair of the editorial committee. This series would replace the

dissertation and special studies series. deClaisse-Walford introduced Glenn Jonas, who reported

that the Editorial Board Nominating Committee had invited three new members: Phyllis

Rodgerson Pleasants (BTSR), Robert Shedinger (Luther College), and L. Dean Allen (Andover

Newton).

The meeting was adjourned at 11:30 am.
