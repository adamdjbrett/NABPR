## Membership Dues to NABPR

Please use the following table to calculate your annual dues. Send check payable to The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion (or nabpr) to:

NABPR c/o Religion Department Baylor University One Bear Place #97294 Waco, TX 76798-7294

Please include your member number (check the mailing label of your most recent newsletter or issue of the journal) on your check. Please include any change of address with your correspondence.

The official dues schedule for NABPR is below. In 1992 an income based dues structure was adopted and this model had been used and updated throughout the years until a change was requested, after much deliberation and voting upon the dues structure at the May 2019 meeting the new revised flat rate dues structure passed and has been implemented as of October 3, 2019. Hopefully this clarified dues structure will be easier for everyone to use. _Thank you so much for your support of NABPR. Due to your generosity, we are able to fund NABPR initiatives, such as our journal, Perspectives in Religious Studies, the NABPR Dissertation Scholarship, the November meeting with AAR/SBL, and the Annual May meeting. I sincerely appreciate your willingness to join and renew membership to our organization._
