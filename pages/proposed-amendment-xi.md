# **Emended 22 May 2018**
## **FIRST DRAFT:**

Article XI. Public Statements

In rare and extreme situations that call for a public response, members of NABPR can vote, either at a national gathering or through an online process, to make a public statement based on the following guidelines: 1) the issue(s) should impact members of NABPR, Baptist scholarship, and/or teachers of religion; 2) individuals may recommend statements to the executive committee; 3) the executive committee will vet all potential statements before rejecting or commending them to the membership; 4) a timely vote of two thirds of members present or total membership (on-line) will be required to make the statement public.

**_Based on Executive Committee feedback that prefers 75% vote of dues-paying members, we will need to take votes exclusively online. Meetings will need to be reserved for discussion, but voting will have to be monitored by Joyce and Adam or whoever does the work of membership maintenance going forward._**
