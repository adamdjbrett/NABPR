<p style="margin-left: 12.75pt; line-height: 135%; background: white;">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">In<br /> the last decade or so, theologians and missiologists have constructed various<br /> theologies of mission.  According to John<br /> Flett, the deeply ingrained Christendom habits of thought have often remained<br /> unchallenged in contemporary rethinking of the relationship between church and<br /> mission.  And Willie Jennings has<br /> challenged Christian theology (and mission) to take seriously its colonial<br /> history and its colonial sites for grasping the full range of its<br /> identity.  How can Christian theologians<br /> and missiologists construct a theology of mission in a postcolonial<br /> perspective? Why is it important for Christian theology and a Christian<br /> theology of mission to take seriously its colonial history?  What would it mean to refract the concept of<br /> the <i>missio Dei</i> through a postcolonial<br /> lens?  How might a postcolonial<br /> perspective reshape and transforms missional ecclesiologies in North America?</span>
