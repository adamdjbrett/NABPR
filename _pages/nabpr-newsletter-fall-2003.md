<b>Polity and Postmodernism</b>
<b>Bill J. Leonard (Wake Forest Divinity School)</b>

During September 2003 I learned a great deal about the changing nature of religious life in religious communions worldwide. Two weeks ago I was the only Baptist and the only North American Protestant at a Catholic-sponsored gathering in Bruges, Belgium centered on the topic of "synodality," and aimed at exploring the nature of polity and governance in post-modern Christianity. Most of the 30-odd delegates were European Catholics, exploring the nature of the episcopacy in the RCC forty years after Vatican II. Many were not optimistic. Other Anglican, Orthodox, Methodist and Evangelical representatives reflected on the boundaries of ecumenical dialogue and the turmoil in their own traditions. Hearing the presentations and giving a paper on Baptist polity, I realized how radical and unwieldy Baptists ways of organizing and understanding the nature of the church look when compared with other ecclesial systems. Yet I also sensed that the pluralism, localism and congregationalism characteristic of Baptist "messiness" increasingly find their way into other traditions. Going to mass celebrated in French, I was also aware of the continuing distance between communions at the Table. At the time for "summing up," I suggested (for what it was worth) that Baptist polity might give others hints of ways to understand these grass-roots "peoples' movements" present in "post-modern" faith communities. Returning to the US, I ventured to a Lutheran retreat near Asheville, NC, having been invited to conduct a workshop on the history of Premillennialism for a pastors whose church members are using the language of that theory of the Second Coming under the influence of the <i>Left Behind</i> series. Baptists may be helpful in teaching Lutherans to speak another theological language! Discussions led beyond the history to the implications of popular religious literature, the impact of eschatological speculations on government policy, and religion in the public square. That same week I read the <i>NY Times</i> report on the financial "crisis" in the SBC relative to funding and (implicitly at least) denominational identity in what has often been described as America's most "in tact" denomination. Thus the paradox: While the "Baptistification" of local congregations influences and frustrates multiple religious traditions, "Baptistness" itself is certainly not static but is also subject to the permanent transition sweeping American religious life. Sooner or later demography catches up with Catholics and Lutherans, Premillennialists and Inerrantists. Then what?

<b>Preview of the Annual Meeting</b>

<b>Nancy L. deClaissé-Walford (McAfee School of Theology, Mercer </b><b>University) </b>

<b>Vice President, NABPR, 2003</b>

The national NABPR meeting will be held on Saturday, November 22, at 9:00 at the Hyatt Hotel in Atlanta. Bill Leonard, this year's president, will speak at 9:15 on "Changing a Theology: Baptists and Globalism Then and Now." At 10:00, three of our members, Mark McIntire of Belmont University, David May of Central Baptist Theological Seminary, and Sally Smith Holt of William Jewell College will present a review of Andrew Linzey's 1995 book, <i>Animal Theology</i>. Andrew Linzey holds a senior research fellowship (the world's first) in theology and animal welfare at Oxford University. In <i>Animal Theology</i>, Linzey begins with the premise that a humanocentric view of the world dominates in our culture and that we as human beings, therefore, view the earth and all that is in it as ours to use as we wish. He urges readers to adopt a theocentric view of the world; an understanding of humans as co-caretakers with God of the world; and a sense of obligation to other "sentient" beings. Using the earthly life of Jesus as his model for human behavior, Linzey argues that the weak and defenseless in the world should be given "not equal, but greater consideration, (that is) the weak should have moral priority." Therefore, says Linzey, humanity is called upon to participate in "a co-operating with God in the healing and liberation of creation." Join us as we explore this interesting, controversial, and thought-provoking book.

Following the presentation, Bill Leonard and Molly Marshall made a special presentation to Richard Wilson in honor of his ten years of service to the NABPR as Executive Secretary-Treasurer. (These ten years were preceded by two years of service as Assistant Executive Secretary-Treasurer.) Wilson was presented with both a framed resolution, read by Leonard, and a plaque of appreciation. The Association unanimously endorsed the resolution. Dr. Wilson then made brief comments of appreciation and reflection on the past accomplishments and future promise of the Association. Replacing Wilson as Executive Secretary-Treasurer is Danny Mynatt.

There was no opposition, and the nominees were elected by unanimous vote. Marshall then recognized Bill Leonard, chair of the Editorial Board, for the report of the board and to report on the Editorial Board Nominating Committee.
