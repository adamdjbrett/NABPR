<p style="line-height: 135%; background: white;"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">NABPR RAL 2012 Call for Papers</span></b></p>

<p style="line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">The NABPR Region-at-Large
welcomes proposals from NABPR and CTS members on topics related to the
conference theme, </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">"Found
in Translation:  Living Faith in Other Contexts."  </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">Possibilities
for paper proposals include, but are not limited to, themes such as:</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">1. Immigration/Migration</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10.5pt; line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">Paper
proposals might consider the following:
the interconnections between race, immigration/migration, religion and
politics; the interconnections between immigration/migration and the Eucharist;
the interconnections between immigration/migration and eschatology; how the
Christian tradition has addressed the duty to welcome the stranger and
cultivated the virtue of hospitality; how immigration/migration affect the use
of such terms as “aliens” and “exiles” in contemporary ecclesiology;</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">the theological significance of the fact
that the Holy Family were immigrants to Egypt shortly after the first Christmas;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">
and, in a 21<sup>st</sup> century globalized world, can migration be considered
a fifth mark of the church?</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">2.  <i>Missio
Dei<b> </b></i>and<b><i> </i></b>Missiology in
Postcolonial Perspective</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12.75pt; line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">In
the last decade or so, theologians and missiologists have constructed various
theologies of mission.  According to John
Flett, the deeply ingrained Christendom habits of thought have often remained
unchallenged in contemporary rethinking of the relationship between church and
mission.  And Willie Jennings has
challenged Christian theology (and mission) to take seriously its colonial
history and its colonial sites for grasping the full range of its
identity.  How can Christian theologians
and missiologists construct a theology of mission in a postcolonial
perspective? Why is it important for Christian theology and a Christian
theology of mission to take seriously its colonial history?  What would it mean to refract the concept of
the <i>missio Dei</i> through a postcolonial
lens?  How might a postcolonial
perspective reshape and transforms missional ecclesiologies in North America?</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">3.  The Theology and Ethics of John Howard Yoder</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8.25pt; line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">Paper
proposals might consider the following:
interconnections between history and eschatology in Yoder’s work; the
significance of memory in Yoder’s theology and politics; engagements with
Yoder’s <i>The Jewish-Christian Schism
Revisited</i>; conversations between Yoder and continental philosophy;
engagements with recent, new readings of Yoder’s work. </span></p>

<p style="line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">4.  Baptists and the Communion of Saints</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10.5pt; line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">Paper
proposals might consider the following:
Baptists and the communion of saints; Baptists’ scholarly engagements
with particular saints of the church; Baptists and Mariology; theological
reflection on Baptist commemoration of the saints;  the possibility of a Baptist sanctoral cycle;
who are Baptist saints, and why?</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 135%; background: white;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 135%;">5.  Responses to David Bebbington’s <i>Baptists through the Centuries:  A History of a Global People </i>(Baylor
