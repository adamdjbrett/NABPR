<span style="color: #cc6600; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large;">From the Executive Secretary, Danny Mynatt, Anderson University</span>

As you know, we have scheduled our 2008 Annual Meeting at Belmont University, May 18 – 20, 2008. The separation of AAR and SBL was the factor which influenced the new Annual Meeting format, but I am excited that we will have more time to engage in discussion and fellowship. The Call for Papers was distributed by email in early October, but it is also included with this newsletter. I encourage you to participate, either by attending or presenting. If you have an idea that you always wanted to develop in an academic setting, this is your opportunity. Proposals from all topics related to Religion are welcome. Also, graduate students are welcome and encouraged to present.

If you have questions about the Annual Meeting program, please let me know. You will receive information about accommodations from me later in the year. I have asked Darrell Gwaltney, Dean of the School of Religion at Belmont, to address this year’s Annual Meeting as a way of introducing the new meeting format and answering any questions.

I hope to see you there.

<span style="color: #cc6600; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large;">A Community of Teaching Scholars</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">
Pamela Scalise, Fuller Theological Seminary</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">Members of the NABPR will gather to conduct our business in San Diego on Saturday, November 17. We will receive good reports regarding our finances and our publishing program (the journal, Perspectives in Religious Studies and the new monograph series, PRSMS), elect officers for the coming year, and welcome new members. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">We will also welcome Chad Eggleston as the recipient of the 2007 NABPR Dissertation Scholarship. The scholarship program provides a volunteer Baptist faculty mentor and a one-time award of $3000 plus two $1000 travel stipends to attend the NABPR national meeting for two years. Eggleston, a graduate of Samford University and Duke University Divinity School, is a Ph. D. candidate at Duke University. His dissertation, “See and Read these Words” (Jer 51, 61): The Concept of the Written in the Book of Jeremiah, is supervised by Ellen Davis. Curtis Freeman is his faculty mentor. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">With Coleman Fannin, Chad Eggleston is co-founder of the NABPR Doctoral Student Network. Young Baptist scholars are welcome to join this online community. (Send contact information to cle3@duke.edu) </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">Since its founding in 1981, the NABPR has met in conjunction with the joint annual meeting of the AAR and SBL. The separation of the AAR from the SBL will require us to change the familiar pattern of Saturday morning gatherings beginning in 2008. We should rejoice that we Baptists did not initiate this break-up, and look forward to more significant opportunities to promote communication and cooperation! Read about next year’s NABPR annual meeting in the article by Danny Mynatt in this newsletter and the Call for Papers that you received recently.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">Come early and stay late on November 17 to renew your relationships within the NABPR community of teaching scholars. </span>

Tim Crawford, Bluefield College</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">We have an excellent program for our San Diego meeting.  As usual, it begins with the Presidential address; Pamela Scalise’s title is "The End of the Old Testament: Reading Exile in the Hebrew Bible."  Afterwards, a panel discussion will feature short presentations by three Old Testament/Hebrew Bible professors regarding how they treat the topic of Yahweh War/Holy War in their courses. Gerald Keown (Gardner-Webb University Divinity School), Carol Grizzard (Pikeville College), and Mark McEntire (Belmont University) have agreed to tell us how they deal with the topic, not merely as a historical curiosity or feature of the text, but as a theological issue which has a profound influence on how Israel’s story is told in the Bible.  The title for their presentations is “Yahweh War as Scripture in the Classroom.” I believe all of us can profit from their experience and share some ideas that will aid us in processing this important and controversial concept with our students.</span>

<span style="color: #cc6600; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large;">Minutes: 2006 Meeting</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion
Minutes of the twenty-sixth Annual Meeting
18 November 2006
Washington Convention Center
Washington, DC</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">The twenty-sixth annual meeting of the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion was called to order by President Curtis Freeman. After a greeting, the association observed a moment of silence in honor of Henry Jackson “Jack” Flanders, Jr. (Baylor), who died the previous year. After the moment of silence and a benediction, Danny Mynatt, Executive Secretary, greeted members and guests and introduced the program for the meeting. Mynatt announced that the Dissertation Scholarship winners in the inaugural year of the award were Scott Becker and Kristian Angelov.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">Pam Scalise introduced Curtis Freeman for the presidential address. Freeman’s address was entitled “Roger Williams Among the Baptists,” and it featured a historiographical review of Williams’s reputation as an advocate for religious liberty. Freeman honored Williams’s Baptist witness while opposing those who have interpreted him in a modernistic and individualistic framework.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">Pam Scalise introduced the program, which featured a panel discussion on the topic “Baptists and the Ten Commandments.” Panelists were Walter Harrelson (Wake Forest University), Bill J. Leonard (Wake Forest University), and Glen Stassen (Fuller Theological Seminary).</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;"> At 11:00, President Curtis Freeman convened the annual business session. After the 2005 minutes were approved, Executive Secretary Danny Mynatt gave the Executive Committee report. Mynatt updated the membership on the current status of the Endowment Funds, which posted a gain of +27.1% for the year. He also noted that dues-paying membership was up 30%.
Mynatt reported on the NABPR strategy for meeting following the breakup of the AAR/SBL annual meetings. He presented a proposal for the new Annual Meeting format, which was decided by the NABPR News online poll. The proposal read as follows: “The Annual Meeting will now move to a time during the last half of May (the Sunday – Tuesday commencing with the 3rd Sunday in May has been suggested). The NABPR Executive Committee will appoint a program committee to create an agenda for the meeting, but it will include more program opportunities for academic papers and fellowship gatherings. The schedule for the meetings will occur in this rotation (after which, the rotation will repeat):
2008-Belmont
2009-Baylor
2010-Mercer
2011-AAR/SBL meets jointly-We will return to the traditional format for that year. Otherwise, this would be an “Open” year, for a new school to volunteer.” The association approved the proposal.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">After the Executive Committee report, Assistant Executive Secretary Jimmy Byrd read the names of nominations for new members into the association. After the new members were approved, Curtis Freeman recognized the Association Nominating Committee, which offered the nominations of Pam Scalise for President and Tim Crawford for Vice President.  Curtis Freeman and Danny Mynatt led a discussion of a change to the NABPR constitution to allow for a Dissertation Scholarship Committee. The recommendation passed.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">The meeting was adjourned at 11:30 am.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">Respectfully submitted, Jimmy Byrd, Vanderbilt University</span>
