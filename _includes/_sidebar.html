			The <a href="/" title="NABPR: National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion">National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion</a> is a community of teaching scholars. Most members teach at Baptist-affiliated schools, colleges, and seminaries, but members also hail from a wide range of institutions in the United States, Canada, and abroad, including church-related and state-supported schools. The history of the association is woven into the changing religious culture of the United States. From the late 1920s until 1981 there were several organizations of Baptists who were teaching scholars in different regions of the country. From their beginnings those regional organizations reflected efforts of men and women engaged in similar tasks in similar settings to find ways to sharpen teaching skills and encourage the continuation of meaningful scholarship. The immediate predecessor of the NABPR was a group of Baptist teaching scholars in the Southeast who, in 1972 founded a journal, Perspectives in Religious Studies, laying a foundation of publications that continues to identify the work of the Association.<a href="/info/">About â€º</a>
