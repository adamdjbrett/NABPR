At its May 2018 meeting, the NABPR honored Dr. Scott Nash for twenty years of service as Senior Editor of [Perspectives in Religious Studies](https://nabpr.org/publications/). Nash, the Columbus Roberts Professor of New Testament at Mercer University, informed the PRSt editorial board last summer (2017) of his decision to step down from his role as Senior Editor, a position he has held since 1998. He was responsible for the operational side of the journal, and under his editorship the PRSt publications endowment grew from several hundred dollars to over $40,000. He was presented with a plaque and a check for $1000 in recognition for his service.
