This amendment allows NABPR to make public statements, after being vetted by the Executive Committee and approved by the membership. The amendment passed 43 to 9. This amendment makes the first time that the Constitution has been changed since 2006, when the Dissertation Scholarship was added. [The constitution has been emended](/about-nabpr/constitution/).
