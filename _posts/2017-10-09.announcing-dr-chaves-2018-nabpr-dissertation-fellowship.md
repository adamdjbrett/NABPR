<h3><strong>2018 Dissertation Scholarship</strong></h3>

The NABPR is committed to supporting academically qualified scholars and teachers of religion for the Baptist academy who carry out their teaching and research with a sense of Baptist identity. The particular purpose of the NABPR dissertation scholarship is to foster conversations about what it means to be a Baptist teacher and scholar in relationship to church and academy, thus contributing to the formation of students in a Baptist tradition and the support of important research by Baptist doctoral students.

One scholarship of $3,000 will be awarded each year. Recipients will be invited to attend the National NABPR meeting in the year the award is granted where they will be recognized by the association. Recipients may also be invited to attend subsequent workshops on Baptists and higher education.
