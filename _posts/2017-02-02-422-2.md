**Call for Papers ****“The Church’s Public Witness”**  
A Scholarly Conference held in conjunction with the ABC/USA Biennial Mission Summit  
_Portland Convention Center, Portland, Oregon_  
**June 29****th****, 2017**

The Office of the General Secretary of ABC-USA and the Theologians Commission will host the fourth pre-biennial theology conference around the theme **_The Church’s Public Witness_** in an effort to foster ongoing, vigorous theological conversations among American Baptist theologians, pastor-theologians, and theological educators throughout the denomination.

The Theologians Commission invites proposals of presentations that address (American) Baptist notions of _The Church’s Public Witness_. Scholars in social ethics, systematic theology, biblical studies, church history, missiology, and practical theology are invited to offer proposals for a 20-minute presentation. Additionally, panels of three participants may be proposed. Presentations that explore the views and perspectives of under-represented groups are encouraged.

**Proposals should be 750-1,000 words**, and make explicit the paper’s connection to the conference theme. Proposals must include: the author’s full name, paper title, institutional affiliation, email and telephone contact. These proposals, **due <span tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1496140908">March 15</span>**, 2017, should include a brief summary of the argument to be made and beginning bibliography.

**Full papers may then be submitted for publication consideration to the _American Baptist Quarterly_.** Authors should attend to the audience as readers rather than listeners. Papers submitted for publication should be approximately 20 pages long (12-point font, double-spaced) and must be fully footnoted. The deadline for submission to _ABQ_ editors is <span tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1496140909">August 1, 2017</span>. Guidelines for authors will be distributed to conference presenters.
