## Summary
Central Baptist Theological Seminary (CBTS) seeks a committed Christian leader of outstanding character, who has extraordinary leadership experience, theological depth, and the personal qualities that predict exceptional success in fund development.  The President will be responsible for leading the organization as it continues to grow and expand to reach more students through innovative programs. The President will report to the Board of Directors and will work closely with the Board’s Executive Committee on operational issues. The desired start date is July 1, 2020.

## About CBTS
Over the last fifteen years, Central has earned a highly respected position in seminary education by developing a culture that is characterized by creative innovation in ministry preparation, an uncommon commitment to diversity, and fiscal responsibility.  As a stand-alone seminary in an industry segment in which maintaining financial viability is increasingly difficult, Central has been successful through entrepreneurial vision and creative approaches to education and financial management. The Seminary campus is now a state-of-the-art facility. Whereas the typical higher education business model relies on a mix of tuition revenue, endowment, and philanthropy, two-thirds of the Seminary’s revenue is provided by donors (individuals, foundations and corporations) and one-third of its income is derived from tuition. This model of philanthropic revenue and tight financial controls is likely the model of the future for successful seminaries.  Certainly, it is for Central.

## Responsibilities

- Articulate and implement a vision consistent with the strategic plan which will provide a foundation for theological education and preparation in rapidly changing cultures and which captures the unique ethos of Central Seminary;
