The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion (NABPR) invites paper proposals in any area pertaining to scholarship in Religion.  In an effort to develop innovative conversations among scholars, papers which create integration between traditional disciplines or broaden the margins of disciplinary conversations are encouraged.   Although many NABPR members work primarily in the traditional disciplines of Biblical Studies, Church History, Theology, etc., proposals are encouraged from any field, including Ministry Studies.

**Paper or panel proposals on any aspect of pedagogy related to the teaching of Religion are encouraged.**

Proposals must be received by January 15, 2018.  Send a 300-word abstract to:

  * Papers will be scheduled into a 30 minute time period, including discussion.
  * Proposals will be accepted or denied by March 1, 2018.
