I’m sad to announce that we will cancel our May 18-20 Annual Meeting.  The decision to cancel is based on three factors:

1. The health of all of our membership is the top priority.  Perhaps by mid-May, things will be better but I suspect we will still be dealing with COVID-19 fallout.

2. Baylor has suspended all conferences through the end of their semester.  That takes us to just prior to the NABPR conference, but I suspect the suspension could be extended until the end of May.

3. Several schools have suspended their travel money through May.  Thus, it seems unlikely that we could muster the usual attendance.

The good news is that Baylor has welcomed us to have a “do-over” for May 17-20, 2021.   We plan to use the same sessions/papers/presenters in 2021 that we were going to use this year.  For presenters who must withdraw for any reason, no problem!  Just let me know at some point before next year’s deadline (Jan. 15, 2021).  We will fill additional openings through next year’s Call for Papers.  If you were scheduled to present and will be able to come to Baylor in 2021, just put your presentation in a holding pattern.

If you have any questions or concerns about the cancellation for this year and the plans for next year, please let me know.

Until our November meeting this year with AAR/SBL, stay safe and healthy!
