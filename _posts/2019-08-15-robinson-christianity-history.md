NABPR member Michael (Mike) Robinson, Professor of Christian Studies at University of Mary Hardin-Baylor has published a new book entitled: *Christianity: A Brief History*. This book is designed to serve as a survey text for undergraduate and seminary courses on Christian history.

Book Description via [Cascade Books](https://wipfandstock.com/christianity-a-brief-history.html):
>Christianity is one of the world’s great religions, with more than two thousand years of history and over two billion adherents worldwide. But what is Christianity? Where did it come from? How did it develop to its current forms? What doctrines do Christians affirm? What ethical norms do they endorse? What relationships between church and state do they champion, and why? What changes have transpired for the faith over the centuries? And what new challenges does Christianity face in the contemporary world? These and other questions are addressed in _Michael Robinson’s Christianity: A Brief History_.
