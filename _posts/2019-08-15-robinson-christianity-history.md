NABPR member Michael (Mike) Robinson, Professor of Christian Studies at Baylor

I wanted to make NABPR aware of a recent book I’ve published entitled, Christianity: A Brief History with Cascade Books (Wipf & Stock).  I don’t know if protocol allows, but if possible (in the right venue) I was wondering if this information could be relayed to the members of NABPR (of which I am a member).  Below is the webpage connected with this title. (I’m hoping the text will be useful as a textbook for undergraduate classes or seminary courses in Christian history).  Thanks for whatever help you might be able to give me in this matters.  If you need more from me, let me know and I’ll try to accommodate.



Thanks for  your time!



Sincerely,



Michael (Mike) Robinson, PhD

Professor of Christian Studies

University of Mary Hardin-Baylor
