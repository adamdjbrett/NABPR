NABPR member Barry Harvey, professor of Theology in the Honors College and the graduate faculty in Religion at Baylor University has published a revised and expanded second edition of *Can These Bones Live?*. The [preface and introduction](http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/baptists-and-the-catholic-tradition-2nd-edition/392851) are available as a a free download on [Baker Academic's site](http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/baptists-and-the-catholic-tradition-2nd-edition/392851). Professor Harvey's previous books include *Taking Hold of the Real: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity* (Wipf and Stock, 2015), and *StormFront: The Good News of God*, with James V. Brownson, Inagrace T. Dietterich and Charles C. West (W.B. Eerdmans, 2003).

>Barry Harvey provides a doctrine of the church that combines Baptist distinctives and origins with an unbending commitment to the visible church as the social body of Christ. Speaking to the broader Christian community, Harvey updates, streamlines, and recontextualizes the arguments he made in an earlier edition of this book (*Can These Bones Live?*). This new edition offers a style of ecclesial witness that can help Christian churches engage culture. Harvey suggests new ways Baptists can engage ecumenically with Catholics and other Protestants, offers insights for Christian worship and practice, and shows how the fragmented body of Christ can be re-membered after Christendom.
