<div>Congratulations to NABPR <a href="https://nabpr.org/disssertation/">Dissertation Scholarship</a> Awardee: João Chaves! Best wishes to him on the journey of dissertation.</div>

<div></div>

<h3>About João Chaves.</h3>

<div>João Chaves is a PhD candidate in the Religion Department of Baylor University, where he also did an outside minor in sociology; he holds degree in theology, biblical and theological studies, and cross-cultural studies. Joao published several peer reviewed articles and book chapters on history of Christianity, theology, and education, and he is the author of <i>Evangelicals and Liberation Revisited: An Inquiry Into the Possibility of an Evangelical-Liberationist Theology </i>(Wipf &amp; Stock, 2013). Joao's dissertation focuses on the development of religious identity and practice across transnational contexts. More specifically, João is writing on how the work of the Foreign Mission Board in Brazil—which was heavily  informed by the Jim Crow imagination of Southern Baptist missionaries—was disseminated effectively through missionary control of denominational institutions of cultural production (e.g. seminaries, publication houses, and denominational periodicals) and is now being re-imagined in Brazilian Baptist churches in the United States, which are being challenged to re-negotiate aspects of their religious ideologies in the context of the ethnic communities of the new immigration. João lives in San Antonio with his wife, Paula, and his “little Americans,” Jonathan and Rebecca. He is a lecturer at the Baptist University of the Américas.</div>
