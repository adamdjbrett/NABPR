Dear Conference Participants,

We wish you safe travels as you make your way to Nashville. We look forward to welcoming you here. We have a great program lined up and important networking and conversation are always part of the meeting!

<h2><strong><span data-term="goog_1008384064">Monday, May 22</span></strong></h2>

<strong><span data-term="goog_1008384065">3:00-6:30</span>       Registration Check-in</strong>

<strong>                       Foyer of Frist Lecture Hall</strong>

<strong>                       4<sup>th</sup> Floor, Inman Health Sciences Building</strong>

Those who requested Belmont housing will pay at registration
and then be directed to the residence hall for check-in

and key pick-up.

<h3><strong>Parking</strong></h3>

There should always be plenty of "Guest Parking" spaces in the garages beneath the Inman-McWhorter buildings and the Janet Ayers Academic Center.  You can get access to these garages off of Wedgewood Avenue or Acklen Avenue.
