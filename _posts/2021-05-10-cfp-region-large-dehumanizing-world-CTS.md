Dear NABPR Region-at-Large participants,

As First Vice President of the NABPR Region-at-Large, I am pleased to forward to you this information about the program of our upcoming joint meeting with the College Theology Society and registration for the convention.

Here is the link for convention registration and other information: [http://www.collegetheology.org/Annual-Convention](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.collegetheology.org%2FAnnual-Convention&data=04%7C01%7CJoyce_Swoveland%40baylor.edu%7Cf580b27849ba4d6506c608d905bb64b2%7C22d2fb35256a459bbcf4dc23d42dc0a4%7C0%7C0%7C637547125268970603%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=L10hpA6FY7z01EMLf%2BFCSc%2FOV7bXRX4%2FQO7D3zcTLf0%3D&reserved=0)

The registration code that NABPR members will use is **nabpr2021** (all lowercase). While by special arrangement NABPR members are not required to become official CTS members to appear on the program or participate in the conference, we do encourage CTS membership as a means of strengthening the partnership of our organizations (plus, if you do so, you’ll receive a subscription to the CTS journal Horizons and the CTS annual volume, both of which have featured contributions from our own membership).

While we regret that again our meeting will not be face-to-face, we are looking forward to rewarding interactions with one another in our virtual format.

Steve Harmon

First Vice President, NABPR Region-at-Large

**From the College Theology Society**:

On behalf of the CTS Board of Directors and this year's co-chairs, Jessica Coblentz and Daniel Horan, OFM, I write to invite you to register for this year's Annual Meeting of the College Theology Society. The theme is "The Human in a Dehumanizing World: Re-Examining Theological Anthropology and Its Implications." The co-chairs and conveners have worked hard to put together another impressive program for us. We hope you'll join us via Zoom.

The Convention meets from Thursday evening, June 3 until Saturday evening June 5\. We have scheduled no Sunday sessions.

The latest draft of the Convention Program can be [downloaded here](http://www.collegetheology.org/resources/Documents/CTS%202021%20Annual%20ConventionMay7.pdf). Or you may [go directly to registration](http://www.collegetheology.org/Annual-Convention): [http://www.collegetheology.org/Annual-Convention](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.collegetheology.org%2FAnnual-Convention&data=04%7C01%7CJoyce_Swoveland%40baylor.edu%7Cf580b27849ba4d6506c608d905bb64b2%7C22d2fb35256a459bbcf4dc23d42dc0a4%7C0%7C0%7C637547125268990594%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=5bdtl36eykEFylqZENcvJA9dGI%2BJsyax%2F%2BI81fLVDCs%3D&reserved=0) 

We look forward to greeting you on Zoom in June!

If you have questions or concerns about registration or technology, please be in touch with me. Questions or concerns about the program may be directed to [Mary Doak](mailto:mdoak@sandiego.edu) or to one of the co-chairs. 

If you have colleagues or graduate students who would be interested in joining us, please forward this email to them and encourage them to register as well. It is our members who are our best ambassadors!
