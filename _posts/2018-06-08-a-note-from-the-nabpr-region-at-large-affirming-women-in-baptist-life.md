The NABPR Region-at-Large adopted the following resolution during their annual business meeting at the College Theology Society Annual Convention at St. Catherine University in St. Paul, MN, 2 June 2018:

The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion, Region-at-Large, wishes to reaffirm on public record its strong support for the role of women in Baptist life in the full range of ministry, life, and witness, ordained and unordained, historically and in the present time. We repudiate any words and actions that denigrate women and the theologies that justify this denigration. We further affirm the action of the Board of Trustees of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, who on 30 May 2018 severed all ties with former president Paige Patterson in light of his handling of multiple allegations of the abuse and violation of women at schools of which he was president. We express our hope that there will be due process and justice for the women who have been harmed.

Moved by Curtis Freeman, Seconded by Amy L. Chilton, and affirmed unanimously.
