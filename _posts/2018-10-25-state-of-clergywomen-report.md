  Recent past NABPR president, Rev. Dr. <a href="https://eileencampbellreed.org/">Eileen Campbell-Reed</a> has been working to answer the question &#8220;How are women faring in ministry in U.S. churches?.&#8221; In this report she provides not only a statistical accounting but also an analysis of some of the trends.

      [icon name=&#8221;quote-left&#8221; class=&#8221;&#8221; unprefixed_class=&#8221;fa-1x&#8221;] One measure of how women are doing is to consider the statistical status of their entry into ministry and leadership in congregations and other ministry settings. A statistical analysis is one dimension of clergywomen’s faring that we have not been able to gauge in a broad way for two decades – when the last comprehensive reports on clergywomen were published.

      Here are a few of the insights of the report:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        In 1960 women were 2.3% of U.S. clergy. In 2016 women are 20.7% of U.S. clergy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Since 2015 Roman Catholic lay ministers outnumber priests in the U.S., and 80% of them are women.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        In 2017 women remain fewer than 25% of seminary faculty and deans, and just 11% of the presidents.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        In most Mainline denominations, the percentage of clergywomen has doubled or tripled since 1994.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Unitarian Universalist and United Church of Christ clergywomen have reached numerical equity with clergymen.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        More women of color and fewer white women are going to seminary to earn MDivs since 2008.
      </li>
    </ul>
