<div>Recent past NABPR president, Rev. Dr. <a href="https://eileencampbellreed.org/">Eileen Campbell-Reed</a> has been working to answer the question "How are women faring in ministry in U.S. churches?." In this report she provides not only a statistical accounting but also an analysis of some of the trends.</div>

<div>
<blockquote>[icon name="quote-left" class="" unprefixed_class="fa-1x"] One measure of how women are doing is to consider the statistical status of their entry into ministry and leadership in congregations and other ministry settings. A statistical analysis is one dimension of clergywomen’s faring that we have not been able to gauge in a broad way for two decades – when the last comprehensive reports on clergywomen were published.</blockquote>
</div>

<div>
<blockquote>Here are a few of the insights of the report:
<ul>
    <li>In 1960 women were 2.3% of U.S. clergy. In 2016 women are 20.7% of U.S. clergy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Since 2015 Roman Catholic lay ministers outnumber priests in the U.S., and 80% of them are women.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>In 2017 women remain fewer than 25% of seminary faculty and deans, and just 11% of the presidents.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>In most Mainline denominations, the percentage of clergywomen has doubled or tripled since 1994.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Unitarian Universalist and United Church of Christ clergywomen have reached numerical equity with clergymen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>More women of color and fewer white women are going to seminary to earn MDivs since 2008.</li>
</ul>
