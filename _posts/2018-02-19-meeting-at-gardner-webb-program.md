#### **Greetings from the Executive Secretary-Treasurer**

Welcome to the Annual May Meeting of NABPR.

Save the date for 2019:  Campbell University School of Law has committed to host our meeting on May 20 – 22, 2019.  The 2019 meeting will be a joint meeting with the Baptist History and Heritage Society.

The November meeting in Boston was successful.  Mark your calendar for November 17.  Dr. Nancy Ammerman did a wonderful job as our plenary speaker.  We plan to keep the Saturday morning tradition alive in Denver.

Many thanks go to Doug Weaver, our President, and the Gardner-Webb University faculty and staff who have worked hard to bring about another successful meeting.  The online registration and payment portal made the logistics much easier.

I look forward to seeing you in Boiling Springs.

Daniel Mynatt  
Executive Secretary-Treasurer
