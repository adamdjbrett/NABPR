The Office of the General Secretary of ABC-USA and the Theologians' Commission will host the
fifth pre-biennial theology conference around the theme Incarnation and Identity in an
effort to foster ongoing, vigorous theological conversations among American Baptist
theologians, pastor-theologians, and theological educators throughout the denomination.

The Theologians' Commission invites proposals of p1Â·esentations that address notions of
Incarnation and Identity from Baptist perspectives. Scholars of social ethics, systematic
theology, biblical studies, church history, missiology, and practical theology are invited to offer
proposals for a 20-minute presentation. Additionally, panels of three participants may be
proposed. Presentations that explore the views and perspectives of under-represented groups
are encouraged.

Proposals must contain: the author's full name, institutional affiliation, email and telephone
contact, as well as an abstract of the paper. The abstract should include the title and the thesis
of the presentation, a brief summary of the argument to be made, explicit connection to the
conference theme and a beginning bibliography. Proposals sho11ld be between 750 and
1000 words, and are due by February 1st, 2019.

Full papers may then be submitted for publication consideration to the American Baptist Quarterly.
Authors should attend to that audience as readers rather than listeners.
Papers submitted for publication should be 6000-10,000 words long and must be fully
footnoted. The deadline for submission to ABQ editors is August 1, 2019. Guidelines for authors
will be distributed to conference presenters.

Notification of acceptance will be given in March, 2019.

The Theologians Conference will take place in conjunction with the 2019 Biennial Mission
Summit of American Baptist Churches, USA Conferees will gather at the Virginia Beach
Convention Center on Thursday, June 20th, 2019, 8:00am - 5:30pm.
