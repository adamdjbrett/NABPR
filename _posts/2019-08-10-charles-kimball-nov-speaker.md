Greetings NABPR:

I wanted to call attention to the fact that our plenary speaker at the November meeting has a new book out soon.  It is timely, given our current environment.

[_Truth over Fear: Combating the Lies about Islam Paperback_](https://www.wjkbooks.com/Products/066426462X/truth-over-fear.aspx), Charles Kimball (Westminster John Knox Press, August 20, 2019) ISBN-13: 978-0664264628.

I look forward to seeing everyone at San Diego in November!

Danny Mynatt
