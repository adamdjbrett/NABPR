NABPR Colleagues,

The _PRSt_ editorial staff are pleased to announce the addition of a [webpage of Books for Review](https://www.baylor.edu/prs/index.php?id=971674).

As you know, _PRSt_ publishes “cluster reviews” of two or more books. Those clusters are now available on the _PRSt_ “Books for Review” page (the publisher’s webpage is also accessible by clicking on the book’s image). Please peruse the book list and let Steve Harmon ([sharmon@gardner-webb.edu](mailto:sharmon@gardner-webb.edu)) know which book cluster you would like to review. Dr. Harmon will send you the books and let you know the procedures and deadline for submitting your review.

Please also direct your publisher to send copies of your own books to Dr. Harmon for review.

Dr. Steve Harmon  
Professor of Historical Theology  
Gardner-Webb University School of Divinity  
Boiling Springs, North Carolina USA

The book review section has been a vital part of the Journal’s mission since its inception in 1974\. We hope this new initiative will make it easier for the NABPR membership to participate in the review process and to continue the scholarly work of review and evaluation in the Association.

Sincerely,

The _Perspectives in Religious Studies_ Staff

Mikeal Parsons, Senior Editor  
Mandy McMichael, Editor  
Susan Benton, Associate Editor  
Steve Harmon, Book Review Editor
