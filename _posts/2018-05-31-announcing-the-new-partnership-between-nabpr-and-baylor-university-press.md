During the business session at its May 2018 meeting, the NABPR unanimously approved a joint recommendation from the NABPR Executive Committee and PRSt Editorial Board to enter into a publishing agreement with Baylor University Press. Under the new arrangement BUP will assume all operations associated with the publication of the journal, including its printing and distribution. The PRSt Editors and Editorial Board will continue to exercise full control over the content of the journal. The new arrangement will commence with the publication of the fall issue of the journal and details of the agreement will be reviewed after seven years.
