### **Background and Executive Summary**

After twenty years of faithful service as Senior Editor of [NABPR Publications](https://nabpr.org/publications/), Dr. Scott Nash informed the _PRSt_ editorial board last summer (2017) of his decision to relinquish that role in summer, 2018. We will honor Scott for his significant contributions to _PRSt_ and NABPR publications at our meeting at Gardner-Webb in a few days.

We must also make new arrangements for the publication and distribution of the journal. With Scott’s departure, we also lose Mercer University’s generous institutional support in the production and distribution of _PRSt_, as well as housing the backlist inventory of the journal.

In consultation with Carey Newman, Director of [Baylor University Press](http://baylorpress.com), the NABPR Executive Committee and _PRSt_ editorial board propose that Baylor University Press assume all _operational_ activities for _Perspectives in Religious Studies_, beginning with the fall issue of 2018. The main points of the proposed agreement include:

_Financial_. The cost of printing and distribution will shift to Baylor University Press (BUP). BUP will receive all revenues, beginning with the first journal issue produced by BUP. BUP will pay $1,500 to NABPR annually. BUP will absorb all costs of inventory. BUP will have the power to set institutional subscription fees and will manage library collections; NABPR retains jurisdiction over <u>individual</u> membership dues; individual membership to the NABPR will <u>not</u> be considered for determining_PRSt_ revenue, while institutional/library membership will. _ PRSt_ will retain its current assets (including the publications endowment).

_Journal Content. _The _PRSt_ editors and publication board will continue to have exclusive jurisdiction over the academic content of the journal and will manage all correspondence between prospective contributors and authors.

The Baylor University Press Faculty Advisory Committee has given provisional approval of the agreement (pending NABPR approval). The NABPR Executive Committee and _PRSt_ Editorial Board jointly and unanimously recommend this proposal for approval by the NABPR members meeting at Gardner-Webb University on May 22, 2018.
