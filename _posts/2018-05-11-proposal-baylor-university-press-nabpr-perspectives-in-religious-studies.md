<h3><strong>Background and Executive Summary</strong></h3>

After twenty years of faithful service as Senior Editor of <a href="https://nabpr.org/publications/">NABPR Publications</a>, Dr. Scott Nash informed the <em>PRSt</em> editorial board last summer (2017) of his decision to relinquish that role in summer, 2018. We will honor Scott for his significant contributions to <em>PRSt</em> and NABPR publications at our meeting at Gardner-Webb in a few days.

We must also make new arrangements for the publication and distribution of the journal. With Scott’s departure, we also lose Mercer University’s generous institutional support in the production and distribution of <em>PRSt</em>, as well as housing the backlist inventory of the journal.

In consultation with Carey Newman, Director of <a href="http://baylorpress.com">Baylor University Press</a>, the NABPR Executive Committee and <em>PRSt</em> editorial board propose that Baylor University Press assume all <em>operational</em> activities for <em>Perspectives in Religious Studies</em>, beginning with the fall issue of 2018. The main points of the proposed agreement include:

<em>Financial</em>. The cost of printing and distribution will shift to Baylor University Press (BUP). BUP will receive all revenues, beginning with the first journal issue produced by BUP. BUP will pay $1,500 to NABPR annually. BUP will absorb all costs of inventory. BUP will have the power to set institutional subscription fees and will manage library collections; NABPR retains jurisdiction over <u>individual</u> membership dues; individual membership to the NABPR will <u>not</u> be considered for determining<em>PRSt</em> revenue, while institutional/library membership will. <em> PRSt</em> will retain its current assets (including the publications endowment).

<em>Journal Content. </em>The <em>PRSt</em> editors and publication board will continue to have exclusive jurisdiction over the academic content of the journal and will manage all correspondence between prospective contributors and authors.

The Baylor University Press Faculty Advisory Committee has given provisional approval of the agreement (pending NABPR approval). The NABPR Executive Committee and <em>PRSt</em> Editorial Board jointly and unanimously recommend this proposal for approval by the NABPR members meeting at Gardner-Webb University on May 22, 2018.
