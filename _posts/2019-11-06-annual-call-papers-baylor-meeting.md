## The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion
### Annual Meeting
### Call for Papers
Baylor University
Waco, TX
May 18 – 20, 2020

The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion (NABPR) invites paper proposals in any area pertaining to scholarship in Religion.  In an effort to develop innovative conversations among scholars, papers that create integration between traditional disciplines or broaden the margins of disciplinary conversations are encouraged.   Although many NABPR members work primarily in the traditional disciplines of Biblical Studies, Church History, Theology, etc., proposals are encouraged from any field, including Ministry Studies.

Paper or panel proposals on any aspect of pedagogy related to the teaching of Religion are encouraged.

Graduate students are encouraged to submit proposals.  Graduate students must register for the meeting, but the cost is waived, regardless of whether a paper is proposed.

Proposals must be received by January 15, 2020.  Send a 300-word abstract electronically to:
Dr. Christine Jones // [cjones@cn.edu](mailto:cjones@cn.edu)

Papers will be scheduled into a 30-minute time period, including discussion.

Proposals will be accepted or denied by March 1, 2020.

### NABPR Membership Requirement
Authors of accepted proposals must be members of NABPR in good standing by May 1. Authors must pay dues for the current year and be registered for the Annual Meeting. Accepted Papers that have not met these criteria will be removed from the program. Inquires about dues and membership status should be directed to Joyce Swoveland: [joyce_swoveland@baylor.edu](mailto:joyce_swoveland@baylor.edu)
